# CLAUDE.md: redmine_description_macros

Redmine plugin `redmine_description_macros`, run by GEOxyz. Upstream: geen. GEOxyz production branch: `main`.

**Current work: the migration to Redmine 7.** Read
[docs/REDMINE7-MIGRATION.md](docs/REDMINE7-MIGRATION.md) before anything else; it holds the plan,
the measured state, the work list and the rules. Work on branch `redmine70-migration`.

## Always

- Run commands yourself (tests, linters, `rails runner`, a browser) and quote the results. Never
  call something green you did not see green.
- Never skip, delete or weaken a test. Every fix gets a test that fails without it.
- Minimal diffs in this plugin's style; no reformatting, no drive-by refactoring.
- Authorization on every action, `safe_attributes` instead of mass assignment, no SQL from
  params, no secrets in logs, no `html_safe` on user input.
- PostgreSQL and MySQL/MariaDB both supported; migrations reversible.
- I18n for every user-visible string; keep the shipped locales in sync, translated by matching
  existing keys in the same file; no new languages.
- Compare with Redmine core before patching it: https://github.com/jcatrysse/redmine
  (`5.1-stable`, `6.1-stable`, `7.0-stable`, `7.0-stable-GEOxyz`).
- GitHub Actions are manual only (`workflow_dispatch`); never add automatic triggers.
- Never push to the default branch, never force-push a shared branch.

## Testing

```sh
./.codex/redmine_clone.sh 7.0-stable-GEOxyz      # or 5.1-stable / 6.1-stable / 7.0-stable
./.codex/test_setup.sh                                 # RMP_DB=mariadb for MariaDB, RMP_PROVISION_DB=0 if a server runs
./.codex/test_plugin.sh                                # minitest + rspec of this plugin
```
On GitHub the same runs by hand only: Actions > "Redmine tests (manual)" > Run workflow.

## For a new task after the migration

Use the four-role approach (implement, independent review, QA, UX/consistency) and the gates in
docs/REDMINE7-MIGRATION.md ("Rules" and "Definition of done") for any change in this repo.
